Netgine is an open-source project with aim to create a platform for community/reconfigurable wireless networks simulation.
Requested functions are as follows:

1.) 3D environment modeling and generation

2.) Wireless transmitter/receiver modeling

3.) Network traffic simulation

4.) Routing algorithms modeling

5.) Calculation of network properties

Due to the fact that this is a hobby project of one person that can't code and programming languages piss him off, it's hard to estimate the speed of progress of this project.
The development is currently done in Python 3. I expect a transition to C++ in the future.
If simulated models meet the expectations, next phase will be a development of a wireless transmitter/receiver, including software extensions (data sharing and replication, communication, service hosting).
Final goal is a creation of plug&play device, which will act as a node of decentralized, fully autonomous wireless network, scalable up to 100 000 devices.
